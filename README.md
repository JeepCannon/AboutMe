# AboutMe
All about me
I am Dan Cannon. My Background: I live in Minneapolis but grew up in Chicago. I work at US Bank and do data analytics for the wealth management business line. 
I would love to work in the crypto currency industry and the future of finance in general. 
I have chosen this industry because it has job security and is exciting.
